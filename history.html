            <p style="max-width: 1200px; padding-left: 150px;">The name “Mumbai” is a nickname for “Mumbadevi”, a local
                Goddess. This city
                with a beautiful and rich
                heritage is originally built on a group of seven islands- Colaba, Worli, Mazagaon, Parel, Mahim, Old
                Woman’ Island, and Bombay Island. These islands were embodied in the Maurya Empire which was under the
                Buddhist Emperor Ashoka of Magadha. </p>

                    <h1 class="firstevent">Rulers of the<br>7 Isles</h1>
                    <p>But soon after the death of the king Ashoka, these islands came under Satavahanas who are
                        knowns
                        as Andhras in Puranas i.e., an ancient Indian dynasty. And then the islands were ruled by
                        different rulers after the end of another. This city has seen a lot of ruling and indulge a
                        great and rich history.

                        It was 1543 AD when the islands were seized by the Portuguese from Bahadur Shah of Gujarat.
                        The
                        islands were ruled by the Portuguese till 1661. On May 8, 1661, the islands were yielded as
                        a
                        dowry to Charles II of England who married to Catherine of Portugal. So it was then when
                        Bombay
                        became a British possession due to a part of the dowry.</p>

                    <p>By 1347, the islands were under Islamic domination, initially by the Delhi sultanate and
                        later by
                        the Gujarat sultanate, with one of the city's most famous landmarks, the exquisite Haji Ali
                        Dargah, built in 1431 as the tomb of Muslim saint Haji Ali. Sultanate patronage enabled the
                        construction of a large number of Indian Islamic mosques and other buildings, all fine
                        examples
                        of the iconic architectural style - most of which are still standing today.</p>

                    <h1 class="thirdevent">East India Company and the Industrial Revolution</h1>
                    <p>In 1668, King Charles II gave up the isles to the East India Company with annual rent and
                        soon
                        the city was named as “Bombay”. Slowly and steadily within 7-8 years, the city grew and the
                        population increased from 10,000 to 60,000. After seeing this rapid growth, the East India
                        Company decided to move its headquarters from Surat to Bombay.

                        The period of Industrialization started when the then-governor William Hornby incorporated a
                        project despite opposition from the East India Company. Soon after the city saw a lot of
                        changes
                        and an indefinite number of civil engineering projects on the way. And this was the start of
                        the
                        Industrial Revolution where the seven isles were finally turned into one city during 1845.
                        Followed, in 1853, the first railway connection between Bombay and Thane was achieved. After
                        the
                        revolt in 1857, the East India Company lost its control over Bombay.

                        In 1869, Bombay became one of the major ports in India after the Suez Canal was accommodated
                        which created a connection between the Bombay and the rest of the world.

                        Soon the Hindu-Muslim riots broke out again which resulted in massacres and turmoil all over
                        the
                        city. And followed by the Indian freedom movement started from the 1890s and lasted till
                        1940s
                        till India got independence from the British rule.</p>

                    <h1 class="fourthevent">Post <br> Independence</h1>
                    <p>But the struggle wasn’t over. It was posted independence when the actual problems raised. But
                        after the partition of India, and formation of the constitution of India, Bombay went under
                        drastic change. The city expanded rapidly and the Greater Bombay District came into
                        existence by
                        merging Bombay Suburbs and Bombay City.

                        Post-independence, during the 1960s especially, Bombay became the capital of the state
                        Maharashtra of India. And followed, the city saw its struggle turning into achievements.
                        There
                        was a drastic change in the city and soon Mumbai became the commercial capital of India and
                        the
                        population had taken a turnover. </p>

                    <p>One of the historic moments of Mumbai is the emergence of Shiv Sena party in 1966 by Bal
                        Thackeray. A Bombay cartoonist, Bal Thackery was disturbed by the clan marginalization of
                        the
                        native Marathi people due to which, out of a feeling of condemnation, he established this
                        party
                        to fight for the rights of native Marathis.

                        Then, the Shiv Sena led the government with highest votes from the citizens and changed the
                        name
                        to “Mumbai”, a Koli native Marathi’s Goddess “Mumbadevi”.</p>

                    <p>But the city also has seen many sufferings, many losses of lives and many terrorist attacks.
                        There was one bombing in 2002, where 2 people lost their life. While in 2003, Mumbai went
                        under
                        4 bomb attacks and around 59 people were killed. Though no one was found to be responsible
                        for
                        the attacks it’s guessed that it was the doing of a Pakistani based group called as
                        “Lashkar-e-Taiba”. But the most heart wrenching terrorist attack in Mumbai was in the year
                        2008
                        where this particular group has incorporated bombs at four places. Due to which around 174
                        innocents were killed and more than 300 were injured.</p>

            <p style="max-width: 1200px; padding-left: 150px;">Despite every struggle and every suffering, Mumbai is
                considered to be the safest place in India
                where people across the country comes with a lot of dreams. This glorious city which is the business
                capital of India today doesn’t let you down. Like it’s rich heritage and past, the people inhabiting
